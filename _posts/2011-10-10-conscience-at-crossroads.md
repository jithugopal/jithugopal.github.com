A thousand miles behind us  
Another thousand ahead  
At the crossroads we stand  
Whence two futures awaits.  

Reject the path well trodden  
Reject with a perfect conscience  
Heed thee friend, you know not  
What vices that way lie.  

Obscure lies your road  
Prey to the undergrowth, it awaits  
Biding its time, years at a stretch  
For those few, whom sanity forsake.  

If we meet down this lane, dear friend  
Perchance to realize that astray we travelled  
Far too much, far too long  
Will you share the swig with me?  
Or will you have a swig at me?  
When the final hour falls nigh.
