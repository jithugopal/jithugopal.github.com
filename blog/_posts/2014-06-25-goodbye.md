title: 'Goodbye'

From the corner of her room, sitting with arms wrapped around my knees, I watched her. I could the see the colour in her cheeks receding to the recesses of her hairline. She laid on the bed, sprawled, staring at the ceiling with her beautiful blue eyes.

There was something saintly in her repose. Her listless hands resembled one of those Renaissance paintings that I perused at a time when youth, with all its vibrant hues, blessed me. Those hands which reached around to hug me in times of loneliness. Those hands which knew the secrets of the cheesecake I begged for. Those hands which ran through my hair and tickled my ears, on a lazy summer afternoon at a picnic by the riverside. And all that remained on them, are the trails of wonderful life that dripped by.

I have always wanted a background score in my life. Preferrably a jazz tune with rain in the backdrop. If there was one, this is the moment when it stops. This is the moment when the sound of silence overpowers my senses, reaches into my soul with its charred hands, and mercilessly rips out a part of me. Someone that had been with me since my waking memories, or what is left of it.

Tears blurry my vision. I can't see the glint in her beautiful blue eyes anymore.
