<div class="about">
  <p>Hello..</p>
  <p>I am a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jithu-gopal-842119b/" target="_blank">product builder</a> currently working at <a href="https://scripbox.com" target="_blank">Scripbox</a>. Before moving to product, I had spent a better part of my career writing software at <a href="https://twitter.com/nilenso" target="_blank">@nilenso</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/c42engineering" target="_blank">@c42engineering</a>.</p>
  <p>I own a Trek 3700 and enjoy biking in and around the city. I do some star-gazing and occasional bird-watching with my Olympus 10x50 binoculars.
